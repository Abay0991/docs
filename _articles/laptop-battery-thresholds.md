## What are Battery Thresholds?



### FlexiCharger

FlexiCharger is the implementation of charging thresholds in proprietary
firmware, made available as a BIOS setting.

To adjust the top charge, reboot the computer and enter into BIOS by holding
down <kbd>F2</kbd>, and navigate to Advanced, then Advanced Chipset Control,
and set Flexicharger to Enabled. Two new sub-menus will appear, and can be set
to the user's desired percentages. Once configured, save and exit the BIOS.

FlexiCharger can be disabled at any time in the BIOS, which reverts the
charging profile to factory defaults.
